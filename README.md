Watching-Evolution
==================

Overview
--------

"Watching Evolution" was developed as an entry for the 2009 Waterloo-Wellington Science and Engineering Fair (gold medal, best-in-fair) and the 2009 Canada-Wide Science Fair (gold medal). It was also presented at the 2009 Expo-Sciences Internationale in Tunis, Tunisia.

The project aimed to use an original computer program to simulate the process of evolution by natural selection, and determine how environmental processes affect the evolution of populations.

Details
-------

The program is centred around the `bioClock` class, which is a discrete collection of heritable data. The `world` class holds an `mPopulation` of type `bioClock`, and this population evolves based on parameters that are set at run-time (e.g. mutation rate).
